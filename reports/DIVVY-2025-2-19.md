# Weekly Status Report - [2025-2-19]

## Project Status

This week, we progressed our backend implementations and connected it to the frontend of our website. We finished our messaging system where we can have users message each other, create group chats, and event creation. Additionally, we allowed users to customize their profile pictures by using cloudinary. The event creation is still being worked on to meet our satisfaction and we put a hold on security features to meet the beta deadline. So our future plans are to incorporate more security features for users, making event creation more robust, real-time notifications, and if possible start improving our website UI/UX.

### Goals From Last Week

Complete the messaging system (backend + frontend).
Expand testing coverage for backend APIs and frontend UI interactions.
Finish core features to prepare for beta.
Implement group-based features (group chats, shared events).

### Progress & Issues

Successfully completed the messaging system where users can DM each other and create group chats.
Messaging is real-time with time stamps
Users can upload pictures to customize their profile picture
Implemented a beta version of the event creation
Updated README for beta release and how to set our repo locally

### Goals For Next Week

Improve event creation and start connecting it with 3rd party links for payment
Users authentication
Start Notifications for new messages and friend requests

### Long Term Goals

Enhance user profile features (bio and status updates).
Add push notifications for new messages, friend requests, and updates.
Security improvements (better authentication, API protection).
Implement logs for user activity tracking.
Deploy and scale the application to handle more users.
Improve UI/UX of website(dark mode, website layout, colors)
