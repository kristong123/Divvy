# Weekly Status Report - [2025-2-26]

## Project Status

This week, we progressed with creating user/developer documentation, implemented event creation, and working on more quality of life/improvements. We finished our event creation system where users can now create events in group chats and create expenses to show which users owe money to other users. Then users can pay back each other with a venmo link that is set up with the correct amount. Then we created the user/developer documentation to show how to use Divvy and for people who want to contribute to Divvy. User authentication and notifications are still being worked on, mainly connecting the front end with the backend. Finally, we are fixing bugs and planning to improve the UI/UX of Divvy to up its level. We are planning a dark mode feature, @ other users in group chats, updating group chat pictures, and upload images in messages.

### Goals From Last Week
