# Weekly Status Report - [2025-2-12]

## Project Status

This week, we progressed on backend development, setting up deployment environments, and implementing core features. We successfully integrated Render for backend hosting and Vercel for frontend hosting. Continuous Integration (CI) testing was established, covering both frontend and backend components. The friends system was completed, while the messaging system is still being implemented.

### Goals From Last Week

Get user authentication through firebase for user login.
Implement Firebase Friestore for user data.
Start working on core features. Specifically User Login page and Homepage.
Test core features and ensure that they are functional and working smoothly.

### Progress & Issues

Backend:
Successfully deployed the backend using Render.
CI/CD pipeline created for backend testing using GitHub Actions.
Completed the friends system, including sending, accepting, declining, canceling, and removing friends.
Testing suite created for the friends system in the backend.
Started working on the messaging system, but still in progress.
Frontend:
Improved UI implementation for core pages like Login and Dashboard.
Integrated user authentication with Firebase.
Began testing and debugging frontend logic.

### Goals For Next Week

Complete the messaging system (backend + frontend).
Expand testing coverage for backend APIs and frontend UI interactions.
Finish core features to prepare for beta.
Implement group-based features (group chats, shared events).

### Long Term Goals

Finalize messaging system with real-time updates.
Enhance user profile features (profile pictures, bio, status updates).
Add push notifications for new messages, friend requests, and updates.
Security improvements (better authentication, API protection).
Implement logs for user activity tracking.
